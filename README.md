## Things you can learn.
<h3>CSS</h3>
- CSS code demonstrates a combination of flexbox, pseudo-elements, animations, and other styling techniques to create a visually appealing and dynamic analog + digital watch interface.

<h3>Javascript</h3>
- Analog Clock:
The analog clock JavaScript program focuses on creating a visually appealing representation of time. It utilizes <b>DOM manipulation</b> to select clock hands and employs the <b>setInterval function</b> to dynamically update the rotation of the hour, minute, and second hands every second. The code showcases the <b>calculation of rotation degrees based on the current time </b>, allowing for the creation of a classic analog clock interface.

-Digital Clock:
In the digital clock JavaScript program, the emphasis shifts to displaying time in a digital format. By <b>querying DOM elements</b>, the code accesses the hour, minute, second, and AM/PM indicators. The show function formats the current time into a 12-hour clock, and a <b>ternary operator</b> determines whether it's AM or PM. Real-time updates are achieved through the setTimeout function, ensuring the digital clock stays synchronized with the system time. Additionally, <b>string manipulation techniques</b> are employed to format time elements with leading zeros when necessary.

-General Concepts:
Both parts of the code exhibit common programming concepts such as DOM manipulation for interactive web elements, the use of the Date object for time-related functionalities, and the implementation of conditional statements to adjust the clock display based on the current time. The integration of interval and timeout functions highlights the dynamic and real-time nature of these clock displays, providing insights into how JavaScript can be applied to create engaging and functional user interfaces.
